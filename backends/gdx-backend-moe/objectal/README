ObjectAL binding for Intel Multi-OS Engine
------------------------------------------

Unpack the ObjectAL sources to this directory 
(the result should be a directory named ObjectAL).

TODO: The generated inline method stubs are not compiled 
as part of the libgdx build process, and not distributed
with the libgdx native libraries. This is not causing a problem
because these methods are not used by the backend, but it should be 
fixed anyways.
